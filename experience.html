        <h2> Intern: Procter and Gamble </h2>

				<p>
          My most recent work experience was as an R&D intern with Procter and Gamble.  I worked as a process
          development engineer, designing and optimizing manufacturing equipment for Glad trash bags.  My main
          contribution was in the development of a finite element model of the temperature profile within a
          sealing process being developed for reinforced bottoms, in which I expanded our understanding of the
          effect of surface roughness of the film on thermal resistance.  My product is scheduled to hit the shelf
          in JFM 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          P&G was a great experience because I was able to gain exposure to the operating procedures of a corporate
          giant.  Moreover, it was an exceptional opportunity to gain cross functional understanding in fields like
          consumer research and brand management.  In fact, if I were to return full time to the company, I would want
          to do so as an Associate Brand Manager so that I could be involved in the strategy, rather than the
          implementation of innovation.

        <h2> On Campus Research: Vascular Inspired Reactor </h2>

				<p>
					One of my most important on campus experiences has been undergraduate research. Through working alongside
          PhD students and faculty, I have been able to learn through observation how best to apply scientific
          principles to drive learning.  And while I by no means see myself pursuing a career in academia, the same
          principles of rigorous proof of concept and effective experimentation are applicable across all fields.
        </p>
        <p>
					The main project I am working on is a Vascular Inspired Reactor for cell free protein expression.  It utilizes
          a DNA based hydrogel as a scaffold for expression to occur, and transcription factors diffuse through in a
          continuous stream.  The main area in which I took ownership was the modeling of this process for the optimization
          of reactor geometry, which I did via a FEM model in COMSOL.  I also assisted in some of the discovery work,
          practicing general microbiology and biochemistry techniques like SDS PAGE, Western Blot, Bradford Assays,
          etc.

				<h2> Cuyama Orchards: Farmers Market </h2>

				<p>
					My least relevant, but perhaps most formative experience was working at the Farmers Market in high school.
					My first year, I was paid hourly, but I quickly graviated towards earning a commission, because it was far
					more lucrative.  In fact, as a 17 year old high school student, I was earning close to 30$ an hour on weekends
					selling apples.
				</p>
				<p>
					This experience was formative in that I got to appreciate the value in owning ones work.  My first weekend
					at the Pasadena farmers market, I took 156$ in commission.  I paid my 120$ market market fee, 7$ for parking,
					and walked away with 29$ in my pocket.  But as I began developing a customer base and building the local
					recognition of Cuyama Orchards as a brand - investing in wicker baskets for my display, nice tablecloths,
					a hygenic sampoling station - I saw the direct impact of my work on my margins.  The pride I felt in something
					as small and simple as a farmers market stand is something I hope to feel in all work that I do.
