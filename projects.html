        <h2> Oxyponics </h2>
				</a>

				<p>
					Of everything I have worked on, Oxyponics is the project I am most proud of, and also my first iGEM
					project as team lead.  At a surface level, the Cornell iGEM team engineered a primitive communication
					system between biological and mechanical systems based on different wavelengths of transmitted light.
					We furthermore applied this to solve a real world problem - increasing yields in hydroponic systems by
					controlling for oxidative stresses.
        </p>

				<p>
					But the real reason I am proud is that we took a disorganized team, lacking in leadership and direction,
					and laid the foundations for success in years to come.  The year before this project, Cornell iGEM was
					coming off of its worst performance ever at competition.  This year, we won an award for overall “Best
					Supporting Entrepreneurship.”  Moreover, for the first time since I have been on the team, we left room in
					the budget for long overdue capital investments and renewals of supplies.

        <h2> Senior Design Project </h2>
				</a>

				<p>
					I took my senior design class in my junior year so that I could begin a Masters in Engineering
					curriculum early.  The class dealt with computer aided engineering - specifically, how finite
					difference and finite element methodology can be used to enhance engineers ability to differential
					equations within complicated geometries.
        </p>

				<p>
					My project in particular involved the analysis of different blood vessel geometries with respect to
					heat conservation in a human finger.  This follows a major theme in emergent research of emulating
					nature in optimizing designs for a given parameter.  Specifically, from modeling the effects of fluid
					flow within the vasculature of the system on the convective heat loss, we were able to draw conclusions
					regarding the tradeoff between maximizing the insulation offered by the skin, and maximizing the arteriovenous
					temperature gradient so as to retain heat by countercurrent exchange.

        <h2> Legendairy </h2>
				</a>

				<p>
					My first major project at Cornell iGEM was called Legendairy.  In this project, we created a bacteriocin
					based antimicrobial to defend against bovine mastitis.  My personal role was as a member of our wet lab
					subteam, where I was able to take ownership of work involving cloning and experimental design.
        </p>

				<p>
					While this project didn’t do well at competition, it was a formative experience because it highlighted
					things that we could do better.  Legendary was conceptually identical to our previous project: FishPharm.
					We did a fantastic job in understanding our consumer, and the science itself was executed with excellence.
					The problem was that instead of applying a formulaic approach to success, we needed to innovate, year after year,
					in order to consistently remain at the forefront of synthetic biology.  This understanding was well reflected in
					the success of our next project, Oxyponics (see above).
