           	<h2> Rock Climbing </h2>

				<p>

					I started out rock climbing when Cornell built a new wall in their gym.
					Very quickly, I fell in love with the sport - treating routes like any other
					problem waiting to be solved.  Climbing is as much a mental challenge as it is
					physical, and to be a great climber one must plan out the most efficient movements
					and approaches.  It's like solving a puzzle with ones whole body.
