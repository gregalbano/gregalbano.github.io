        <h2> Rock Climbing </h2>

				<p>

					I started out rock climbing when Cornell built a new wall in their gym.
					Very quickly, I fell in love with the sport - treating routes like any other
					problem waiting to be solved.  Climbing is as much a mental challenge as it is
					physical, and to be a great climber one must plan out the most efficient movements
					and approaches.  It's like solving a puzzle with ones whole body.

           	<h2> Chess </h2>

				<p>

				 I	play chess for a very similar reason.  It makes a game out of problem solving.
				 Moreover, to be good at chess involves the combination of short term tactical insight
				 and long term strategic planning.  Only through the marriage of the two can a player
				 be successful.  This appeals to me because, much like in life, the game involves taking
				 the things I am good at - short term tactics -  and leveraging them to achieve overarching
				 success.

				</p>

				<p>

				Chess also appeals to my competitive nature.  Most people like to win.  I like to improve.
				I like to be challenged and fail, then fail again, and again, and again, until at some point
				I succeed.  In chess, there is never a shortage of players who are many times better than you are.
				And to me, there is nothing more rewarding than beating them.
